editor owns state and status. it does NOT know about ui.
commands MUTATE editor state and status. they do NOT touch ui
ui owns drawing and input. it holds a REFERENCE to the editor so it can:
- ACCESS draw stateful attributes
- OBSERVE status to show messages or trigger redraws

action primitives and commands parse input and call action primitives

prompt win always shows commandline buffer if it is open
